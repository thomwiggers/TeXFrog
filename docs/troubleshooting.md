# Troubleshooting & FAQ

Common problems proof authors encounter, organized by symptom. If you have the Python CLI installed and your issue isn't listed here, run `texfrog check --strict proof.tex` first — it catches many problems with clear error messages.

> [!TIP]
> If you are using only the LaTeX package (`texfrog.sty`) without the Python CLI, the sections on [Tag and Filtering Issues](#tag-and-filtering-issues), [LaTeX Build Errors](#latex-build-errors), and the [FAQ](#faq) are relevant to you. The [HTML Build Issues](#html-build-issues) and [`texfrog check`](#texfrog-check-and-validation) sections apply only to the Python CLI.

## Tag and Filtering Issues

### Lines are missing from a game

**Symptom:** A game is missing lines you expected to appear.

**Likely causes:**

1. **Typo in `\tfonly` label.** If you write `\tfonly{G10}{...}` but the game is labeled `G1`, that content silently belongs to no game. Run `texfrog check --strict` — it warns about tags that don't match any game label:

   ```
   Warning: Tag 'G10' in source file does not match any game label. Typo?
   ```

2. **Wrong range endpoints.** Ranges are resolved by position in the `\tfgames` list, not alphabetically. If your list is `G0, G1, Red2, G2`, then `\tfonly{G1-G2}{...}` includes `G1`, `Red2`, *and* `G2`. Double-check that your range covers exactly the games you intend.

3. **Game has no tagged lines.** If a game only receives untagged (common) lines and you expected game-specific lines, verify the tags. `texfrog check --strict` warns:

   ```
   Warning: Game 'G3' has no tagged lines in the source (it only receives untagged common lines)
   ```

### `Range 'G5-G2' is reversed`

**Cause:** The start of the range comes *after* the end in the `games:` list. Ranges are positional — `G2-G5` means "from the position of G2 to the position of G5."

**Fix:** Swap the endpoints: `\tfonly{G2-G5}{...}`.

### Game produces unexpected content or wrong line order

**Cause:** Variant lines for the same logical "slot" are not consecutive in the source file. TeXFrog filters but never reorders.

**Fix:** Group all alternatives for a slot together:

```latex
% Correct: variants are consecutive
\tfonly{G0}{(\ct_2^*, \key_2) \getsr \KEM_2.\encaps(\pk_2) \\}
\tfonly{G1}{(\ct_2^*, \key_2^*) \getsr \KEM_2.\encaps(\pk_2) \\}
\tfonly{G2-G9}{(\ct_2^*, \_\_) \getsr \KEM_2.\encaps(\pk_2) \\}
```

If these were scattered in different parts of the file, each game would see them in the wrong position. See the [Source Ordering Constraint](writing-proofs.md#source-ordering-constraint) section in the writing guide.

### Tag range includes unexpected games (e.g., reductions)

**Cause:** Ranges include *everything* between the two endpoints by position, including reductions. Given the list `G0, G1, Red2, G2, G3`, the range `G1-G3` includes `G1`, `Red2`, `G2`, and `G3`.

**Fix:** This is by design — it lets reductions sit between games without breaking range syntax. If you need to exclude a reduction from a range, use an explicit comma-separated list instead: `\tfonly{G1,G2,G3}{...}`.

## LaTeX Build Errors

### "Dimension too large" from pdflatex

**Cause:** Usually triggered by blank lines inside `pcvstack`/`varwidth` environments (a `cryptocode`-specific issue), or by conflicts with the `preview` package.

**Fixes:**

- **Do NOT** add `\usepackage[active,tightpage]{preview}` to your macro files — it conflicts with `varwidth`, which `pcvstack` uses internally.
- **Do NOT** use `\documentclass{standalone}` — it runs in LR mode, which is incompatible with `pcvstack`.
- TeXFrog automatically strips blank lines from per-game output to prevent this error. If you see it, check for manual edits to the generated `.tex` files, or for `preview`/`standalone` in your macros.

### "! LaTeX Error: File `...` not found"

**Likely causes:**

1. **Missing macro file.** Check that all files referenced by `\tfmacrofile` in your .tex file exist at the specified relative paths. `texfrog check` warns about missing macro files.

2. **Path resolves outside the proof directory.** Paths like `../../../somewhere/macros.tex` that escape the proof directory are rejected:

   ```
   Error: Macro path '../../../lib/macros.tex' resolves outside the proof directory
   ```

   **Fix:** Keep all macro files within or below the directory containing `proof.tex`.

3. **Spaces in file paths.** LaTeX's `\input{}` cannot handle paths with spaces. TeXFrog automatically copies files to a flat temporary directory before running pdflatex to work around this, but if you're running pdflatex manually on the generated files, ensure your paths don't contain spaces.

### Math mode errors (`\mathsf allowed only in math mode`)

**Cause:** Mismatch between the pseudocode package's mode and the `\tfchanged` definition. `cryptocode` content is in math mode; `nicodemus` and `algpseudocodex` content is in text mode.

**Fix:** Ensure your package profile is set correctly via `\usepackage[package=...]{texfrog}`. If you override `\tfchanged`, match the mode:

- **cryptocode:** `\newcommand{\tfchanged}[1]{\colorbox{blue!15}{$#1$}}`
- **nicodemus / algpseudocodex:** `\newcommand{\tfchanged}[1]{\colorbox{blue!15}{#1}}`

The HTML build wrapper handles this automatically. This error usually appears when a cryptocode proof's `\tfchanged` is defined without `$...$` wrapping, or when you accidentally use a text-mode profile (`package=nicodemus` or `package=algpseudocodex`) for a cryptocode proof.

### `\item` or `\State` appearing inside `\tfchanged`

**Cause:** This shouldn't happen — TeXFrog keeps the line prefix outside `\tfchanged{}` to preserve structure: `\item` for nicodemus, `\State` for algpseudocodex. If you see this, check that:

1. Your .tex file uses the matching profile (`\usepackage[package=nicodemus]{texfrog}` or `\usepackage[package=algpseudocodex]{texfrog}`), not the default `cryptocode`.
2. You haven't manually edited the generated output files.

### Highlighting is not applied to some changed lines

**By design.** TeXFrog skips `\tfchanged` wrapping for:

- **Procedure headers** — lines ending with `{` (e.g., `\procedure{Name}{`). Wrapping these would break LaTeX brace matching.
- **Pure comment lines** — lines starting with `%`. These are invisible in the PDF.
- **Environment boundaries** — lines with `\begin{...}` or `\end{...}`.
- **Layout commands** — lines starting with `\markersetlen`.

## HTML Build Issues

### "pdflatex not found"

**Fix:** Install a TeX distribution:

- **macOS:** `brew install --cask mactex`
- **Linux:** `apt install texlive-full`

### "Neither pdftocairo nor pdf2svg found"

**Fix:** Install an SVG converter:

- **macOS:** `brew install poppler` (provides `pdftocairo`) or `brew install pdf2svg`
- **Linux:** `apt install poppler-utils` or `apt install pdf2svg`

### "Warning: pdfcrop not found"

This is a non-fatal warning. Without `pdfcrop`, SVG images will have wider margins but still render correctly.

**Fix:** Install `pdfcrop`:

- **macOS:** `brew install --cask mactex` (included with TeX Live)
- **Linux:** `apt install texlive-extra-utils`

### "pdflatex failed for game ..."

**Likely causes:**

1. **`preview` or `standalone` conflict** — see ["Dimension too large"](#dimension-too-large-from-pdflatex) above.
2. **Missing packages.** The HTML wrapper includes `amsfonts`, `amsmath`, `amsthm`, `adjustbox`, `xcolor`, and your selected pseudocode package. If your macros use additional packages (e.g., `stmaryrd`, `lmodern`), add them via `\tfpreamble{preamble.tex}` in your .tex file, where `preamble.tex` contains:

   ```latex
   \usepackage{stmaryrd}
   \usepackage{lmodern}
   ```

3. **Undefined commands in commentary.** Commentary is compiled through the same LaTeX pipeline as game pseudocode, so commands like `\newtheorem{claim}{Claim}` must be defined in your macros file.

### SVG images have wrong margins or sizes

**Cause:** `pdfcrop` is not installed, or a manual `\documentclass{standalone}` is interfering.

**Fix:** Install `pdfcrop` (see above) and ensure you're not using `standalone` document class in any of your macro files.

### Game names or descriptions render as raw or garbled text in the HTML viewer

**Symptom:** In the proof viewer, the game titles and the sidebar (game names and descriptions) show broken or literal LaTeX — stray backslashes or unknown command names — even though the pseudocode figures themselves render correctly.

**Cause:** Game names (`\tfgamename`) and descriptions (`\tfdescription`) are typeset in the browser by **MathJax**, not by LaTeX. TeXFrog feeds MathJax the custom macros it can harvest from your `\tfmacrofile` files, but it only collects **single-line** definitions written with `\newcommand`, `\renewcommand`, `\providecommand`, `\DeclareMathOperator`, or `\def`. Macros defined with `\NewDocumentCommand`, spread across multiple lines, or produced indirectly (a macro that defines other macros) are not picked up, so MathJax does not know them.

**Fix:** For any macro you use inside a `\tfgamename` or `\tfdescription`, add a plain single-line definition the harvester can read:

```latex
\newcommand{\Bdversary}{\mathcal{B}}   % picked up for MathJax
```

rather than `\NewDocumentCommand{...}` or a multi-line definition. This only affects the MathJax-rendered names and descriptions — the pseudocode figures are compiled with real LaTeX and are unaffected.

## `texfrog check` and Validation

### What does `texfrog check` validate?

`texfrog check` parses and validates your proof without building it. It checks:

- Document structure (required commands, correct syntax)
- Game and figure label validity (safe characters, no duplicates)
- Source file existence and readability
- Macro file existence
- Tag labels (warns about tags that don't match any game)
- Tag ranges (catches reversed ranges)
- Game coverage (warns about games with no tagged lines or empty output)
- Reduction/related_games consistency
- Path safety (files don't escape the proof directory)

### What does `--strict` do?

Without `--strict`, warnings are displayed but the command exits successfully (exit code 0). With `--strict`, any warnings cause exit code 1. Use `--strict` in CI pipelines to catch potential problems early.

## FAQ

### Can I use labels other than G0, G1, etc.?

Yes. Labels are arbitrary strings matching `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`. Common patterns: `G0`–`G9`, `Red1`, `Hybrid3`, `BadEvent`, `Final`. The names are for your convenience — TeXFrog treats them as opaque identifiers.

### How do I add a reduction between two games?

Add it to the `\tfgames` list at the position where it logically sits in the proof sequence. Use `\tfreduction` and optionally `\tfrelatedgames`:

```latex
\tfgames{myproof}{G1, Red2, G2}
\tfgamename{myproof}{G1}{\mathsf{G}_1}
\tfgamename{myproof}{Red2}{\bdv_2}
\tfgamename{myproof}{G2}{\mathsf{G}_2}
\tfdescription{myproof}{G1}{First game.}
\tfdescription{myproof}{Red2}{Reduction against IND-CCA security.}
\tfdescription{myproof}{G2}{Second game.}
\tfreduction{myproof}{Red2}
\tfrelatedgames{myproof}{Red2}{G1,G2}
```

Reductions are included in tag ranges — `G1-G2` in this example includes `Red2`.

### How do I suppress diff highlighting in the final paper?

By default, `\tfrendergame{source}{label}` renders without highlighting. Highlighting only appears when you explicitly request it with `\tfrendergame[diff=target]{source}{label}`. To remove highlighting, simply omit the `diff` option.

If you want to globally suppress highlighting from all `\tfrendergame[diff=...]` calls without editing each one, override `\tfchanged` to be a no-op in your preamble:

```latex
\renewcommand{\tfchanged}[1]{#1}
```

### Can I use custom `\tfchanged` / `\tfgamelabel` definitions?

Yes. The `texfrog.sty` package defines them with `\providecommand`, so you can override them with `\renewcommand` in your preamble.

### Why does `latex_name` not include `$` delimiters?

Because `latex_name` is used in multiple contexts — `\ensuremath` in LaTeX (which handles math mode automatically) and `$...$` in the HTML viewer (for MathJax). Including `$` in `\tfgamename` would double-wrap in some contexts.

### Why are blank lines stripped from output?

Blank lines inside `varwidth` environments (used by cryptocode's `pcvstack`) can cause "Dimension too large" errors. TeXFrog strips them to prevent this. If you need visual spacing, use `\vspace` or similar LaTeX commands on a tagged line.

### My live-reload isn't picking up changes to a new file

The file watcher monitors paths referenced in your .tex file (macro files, preamble, commentary files). After adding a new file via `\tfmacrofile` or `\tfcommentary`, save the .tex file — the watcher refreshes its file set after each rebuild.

### Can I use TeXFrog on Overleaf?

Yes. Upload `texfrog.sty` to your Overleaf project and use it like any other local package — add `\usepackage[package=cryptocode]{texfrog}` to your preamble. Everything that happens at compile time (game filtering, diff highlighting, consolidated figures) works on Overleaf. The Python CLI features (HTML viewer, `texfrog check`, `texfrog init`) are not available on Overleaf, but you don't need them to write and compile proofs.

### Do I need Python to use TeXFrog?

No. The `texfrog.sty` LaTeX package works standalone — just place it in your project directory and compile with `pdflatex`. Python is only needed if you want the interactive HTML proof viewer (`texfrog html`) or the validation/scaffolding commands (`texfrog check`, `texfrog init`).
