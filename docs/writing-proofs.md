# Writing a Proof

This is the reference guide for TeXFrog's `.tex` input format. For a hands-on introduction, start with the [cryptocode quickstart](../examples/tutorial-cryptocode-quickstart/), the [cryptocode tutorial](../examples/tutorial-cryptocode/), the [nicodemus tutorial](../examples/tutorial-nicodemus/), or the [algpseudocodex tutorial](../examples/tutorial-algpseudocodex/) instead.

> [!TIP]
> Run `texfrog init` to scaffold a starter proof with commented templates, then modify the generated files. Use `texfrog init --package nicodemus` or `texfrog init --package algpseudocodex` for nicodemus- or algpseudocodex-flavored templates.

## Overview

A game-hopping proof consists of a sequence of games (and reductions) where adjacent games usually differ by only a few lines of pseudocode. TeXFrog lets you write all games in a single source block, using `\tfonly{tags}{content}` to control which content appears in which game. Lines not wrapped in `\tfonly` appear in every game.

## The .tex Input File

The `.tex` file is the **single source of truth**. It serves two purposes:

1. **Direct LaTeX compilation** via `pdflatex` using the `texfrog.sty` package, which handles game filtering, automatic diff highlighting, and consolidated figures entirely at compile time. This works standalone — you only need `texfrog.sty` in your project directory (or on Overleaf), with no Python installation required.
2. **HTML export** (optional) via the Python CLI tool (`texfrog html build`), which parses the same `.tex` file and builds an interactive HTML site with side-by-side game comparison, commentary, and MathJax rendering.

A minimal `.tex` file looks like this:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[package=cryptocode]{texfrog}

\input{macros.tex}

\tfgames{myproof}{G0, G1, Red1, G2}
\tfgamename{myproof}{G0}{G_0}
\tfgamename{myproof}{G1}{G_1}
\tfgamename{myproof}{Red1}{\Bdversary_1}
\tfgamename{myproof}{G2}{G_2}

\tfdescription{myproof}{G0}{The starting game.}
\tfdescription{myproof}{G1}{Replace PRF with random function.}
\tfdescription{myproof}{Red1}{Reduction to PRF security.}
\tfdescription{myproof}{G2}{Replace random function output with uniform randomness.}

\tfreduction{myproof}{Red1}
\tfrelatedgames{myproof}{Red1}{G0, G1}

\tfmacrofile{macros.tex}

\begin{tfsource}{myproof}
  % ... pseudocode with \tfonly tags ...
\end{tfsource}

\begin{document}
\tfrendergame{myproof}{G0}
\tfrendergame[diff=G0]{myproof}{G1}
\tfrenderfigure{myproof}{G0,G1,G2}
\end{document}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Multiple independent proofs can be defined in a single document by using different source names. Each proof has its own `\tfgames`, `\tfgamename`, `\tfdescription`, etc., all sharing the same source name, and its own `\begin{tfsource}{name}...\end{tfsource}` block.

### Package Selection

Select the pseudocode LaTeX package with the `package` option on `\usepackage`:

```latex
\usepackage[package=cryptocode]{texfrog}   % default
\usepackage[package=nicodemus]{texfrog}
\usepackage[package=algpseudocodex]{texfrog}
```

This controls how TeXFrog generates macro definitions (e.g., whether `\tfchanged` wraps content in math mode), how it handles line separators in consolidated figures, and which packages are loaded in the HTML build wrapper. If the `package` option is omitted, it defaults to `cryptocode`.

### Game Registration

Register the games and reductions in your proof using the following commands. These must appear in the preamble (before `\begin{document}`).

**`\tfgames{source}{G0, G1, Red1, G2}`** declares the ordered list of all games and reductions for the named source. The order here is the canonical sequence of the proof --- it determines which games are "adjacent" for diff highlighting, and it defines what tag ranges like `G0-G2` mean.

**`\tfgamename{source}{label}{latex_name}`** sets the display name for a game. The `latex_name` is math-mode content without `$` delimiters (e.g., `G_0` or `\indcca_\QSH^\adv.\REAL()`). It is rendered via `\ensuremath` in LaTeX and `$...$` in the HTML viewer. Inside a `tfsource` body, `\tfgamename{label}` (1-arg form) can be used as a shorthand that looks up the name from the active source.

```latex
\tfgamename{myproof}{G0}{G_0}
\tfgamename{myproof}{Red1}{\Bdversary_1}
```

**`\tfdescription{source}{label}{text}`** sets a one-sentence LaTeX description shown in the HTML viewer sidebar.

```latex
\tfdescription{myproof}{G0}{The starting game (real IND-CCA game).}
\tfdescription{myproof}{G1}{Replace $\key_2$ with a fresh $\key_2^*$ from encapsulation.}
```

**`\tfreduction{source}{label}`** marks a game as a reduction. In the HTML viewer, reductions are displayed alone rather than side-by-side with the previous game (unless `\tfrelatedgames` is set).

**`\tfrelatedgames{source}{label}{G0, G1}`** specifies zero, one, or two game labels to display alongside a reduction in the HTML viewer. Only valid for games marked with `\tfreduction`. Clean (unhighlighted) versions of these games are shown next to the reduction: one related game gives a 2-panel layout, two gives a 3-panel layout with the reduction in the middle.

```latex
\tfreduction{myproof}{Red2}
\tfrelatedgames{myproof}{Red2}{G1, G2}
```

Labels can be anything: `G0`, `Red2`, `Hybrid3`, `BadEvent` --- TeXFrog treats them as arbitrary strings.

### Macros and Preamble

> [!NOTE]
> The `\tfmacrofile`, `\tfpreamble`, `\tfcommentary`, and `\tffigure` commands are metadata for the Python CLI's HTML export. They are silently ignored during normal `pdflatex` compilation, so they are harmless to include even if you only use the LaTeX package.

**`\tfmacrofile{macros.tex}`** declares a macro file (relative to the `.tex` file's location) that should be included in the HTML build. You can use multiple `\tfmacrofile` commands. `.tex` files are `\input`-ed into the HTML compilation. `.sty` and `.cls` files are copied to the build directory (so `\usepackage` can find them) but are NOT `\input`-ed.

```latex
\tfmacrofile{macros.tex}
\tfmacrofile{../shared/crypto-macros.tex}
\tfmacrofile{nicodemus.sty}
```

**`\tfpreamble{preamble.tex}`** declares a file containing extra `\usepackage` lines needed for the HTML build, relative to the `.tex` file. Use this for packages that your proof needs beyond what the package profile provides. For example, if your macros use `\usepackage{stmaryrd}` or `\usepackage{lmodern}`, list them in the preamble file.

```latex
\tfpreamble{preamble.tex}
```

### Commentary

**`\tfcommentary{source}{label}{commentary/G0.tex}`** associates per-game commentary with a game. The value is a path (relative to the `.tex` file) to a `.tex` file containing free-form LaTeX. Commentary is rendered in the HTML viewer below the game pseudocode.

```latex
\tfcommentary{myproof}{G0}{commentary/G0.tex}
\tfcommentary{myproof}{G1}{commentary/G1.tex}
```

Each commentary file contains raw LaTeX --- environments, math, and display equations all work. For example, `commentary/G1.tex` might contain:

```latex
\begin{claim}
  Games~0 and~1 are indistinguishable assuming correctness of $\KEM_2$.
\end{claim}
This follows by inlining the decapsulation result.
```

You can use `\tfgamename{myproof}{G1}` in commentary to reference a game's `latex_name`.

**HTML viewer:** Commentary is compiled through the same LaTeX -> PDF -> SVG pipeline as game pseudocode, so any LaTeX commands or environments used in commentary (e.g., `\newtheorem{claim}{Claim}`) must be defined in your macros file. The packages available in the HTML compilation wrapper include your selected pseudocode package (e.g., `cryptocode`, `nicodemus`, or `algpseudocodex`), plus `amsfonts`, `amsmath`, `amsthm`, `adjustbox`, and `xcolor`. Additional packages can be added via `\tfpreamble`.

### Figures

**`\tffigure{source}[procedure_name]{label}{games}`** declares a consolidated figure showing multiple games side by side, for use as a comparison table in your paper. The Python HTML tool uses this metadata; `texfrog.sty` provides `\tfrenderfigure` for the LaTeX side.

```latex
\tffigure{myproof}{start_end}{G0,G9}
\tffigure{myproof}[Games $G_0$--$G_9$]{main_proof}{G0-G2,G8,G9}
```

Each figure has:
- `label` --- used as the output filename: `fig_{label}.tex`
- `games` --- comma-separated list or range of game labels (same syntax as `\tfonly` tags)
- `procedure_name` (optional) --- custom title for the first procedure header in the consolidated output. Without this, the first game's header is used verbatim. Useful for showing a collective name like "Games $G_0$--$G_9$" instead of a single game's title.

In the generated figure, lines that appear in all selected games are output verbatim. Lines that appear in only some games are annotated with `\tfgamelabel{G1,G3}{line content}`.

### Proof Source

The `tfsource` environment contains the pseudocode for all games merged together.

**`\begin{tfsource}{name}...\end{tfsource}`** defines a named source block. The `name` is referenced by `\tfrendergame` and `\tfrenderfigure`.

```latex
\begin{tfsource}{indcpa}
\begin{pcvstack}[boxed]
  \procedure[linenumbering]{%
    \tfonly*{G0}{Game $\tfgamename{G0}$}%
    \tfonly*{G1}{Game $\tfgamename{G1}$}%
    \tffigonly{Games $\tfgamename{G0}$--$\tfgamename{G1}$}%
  }{
    \tfonly{G0}{k \getsr \{0,1\}^\lambda \\}
    b \getsr \{0,1\} \\
    b' \gets \Adversary^{\mathsf{LR}}() \\
    \pcreturn (b' = b)
  }
\end{pcvstack}
\end{tfsource}
```

Inside `tfsource`, use the following commands to control which content appears in which games:

**`\tfonly{tags}{content}`** --- content appears only in the listed games. Lines not wrapped in `\tfonly` appear in every game.

```latex
\tfonly{G0}{k \getsr \{0,1\}^\lambda \\}
\tfonly{G1}{y \gets \RF(r) \\}
\tfonly{G2}{y \getsr \{0,1\}^\lambda \\}
```

**`\tfonly*{tags}{content}`** --- like `\tfonly` but suppressed in consolidated figures (`\tfrenderfigure`). Use for per-game procedure headers that should not appear in the combined view.

**`\tffigonly{content}`** --- shown only in consolidated figures, hidden in single-game rendering. Use for a combined header in `\tfrenderfigure` output.

Typical pattern for procedure headers:

```latex
\procedure[linenumbering]{%
  \tfonly*{G0}{Game $\tfgamename{G0}$}%
  \tfonly*{G1}{Game $\tfgamename{G1}$}%
  \tffigonly{Games $\tfgamename{G0}$--$\tfgamename{G1}$}%
}{...}
```

### Tag Syntax

The `tags` argument in `\tfonly{tags}{content}` specifies which games should include the content:

- **Single label**: `\tfonly{G0}{content}`
- **Comma-separated list**: `\tfonly{G0,G3,Red2}{content}`
- **Range**: `\tfonly{G0-G9}{content}` --- includes all games from G0 to G9 *by position in the games list*
- **Mixed**: `\tfonly{G0,G3-G5}{content}`

### Range Resolution

Ranges are resolved **positionally** --- by the order games appear in the `\tfgames` declaration, not alphabetically or numerically. Given the game list `\tfgames{myproof}{G0, G1, G2, Red2, G3, G4}`, the tag `G1-G3` includes `G1`, `G2`, `Red2`, and `G3`, because `Red2` sits between `G2` and `G3` in the sequence.

This lets you insert reductions (e.g., `Red2`) between games without breaking range syntax.

Unknown labels in tags will raise a warning on the command line but otherwise are silently ignored, so a typo like `G10` when `G10` doesn't exist will simply cause the content to appear in no game. Run `texfrog check --strict` to catch these --- see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#lines-are-missing-from-a-game).

### Source Ordering Constraint

**This is the most important constraint in TeXFrog.**

Variant content for the same logical "slot" --- alternatives of each other in different games --- must be **consecutive** in the source. TeXFrog filters content but does not reorder it.

For example, the KEM_2 encaps line varies across games:

```latex
% Correct: variants are consecutive
\tfonly{G0}{(\ct_2^*, \key_2) \getsr \KEM_2.\encaps(\pk_2) \\}
\tfonly{G1}{(\ct_2^*, \key_2^*) \getsr \KEM_2.\encaps(\pk_2) \\}
\tfonly{G2-G9}{(\ct_2^*, \_\_) \getsr \KEM_2.\encaps(\pk_2) \\}
```

If you placed these in different parts of the source, they would all appear together at the wrong point in the filtered output. Keep variants for the same slot consecutive.

### Rendering

Use these commands in the document body to render games and figures.

**`\tfrendergame{source}{label}`** renders a single game without diff highlighting.

**`\tfrendergame[diff=target]{source}{label}`** renders a game with changes highlighted relative to the specified target game.

**`\tfrenderfigure{source}{games}`** renders a consolidated figure showing multiple games side by side.

```latex
\tfrendergame{indcpa}{G0}                     % no highlighting
\tfrendergame[diff=G0]{indcpa}{G1}            % changes from G0 highlighted
\tfrendergame{indcpa}{G1}                     % clean, no highlighting
\tfrenderfigure{indcpa}{G0,G1,G2,G3}          % consolidated figure
```

### Lines That Are Not Wrapped in `\tfchanged`

When generating the LaTeX output, TeXFrog wraps changed lines in `\tfchanged{}` to highlight them. Two kinds of lines are never wrapped, even if they changed:

- **Procedure headers**: lines ending with `{` (e.g., `\procedure{Name}{`). Wrapping these would break LaTeX brace matching.
- **Pure comment lines**: lines that start with `%`. These are invisible in the PDF, so wrapping them is pointless.

### Tips for Writing the Source

**Structure your source top-to-bottom** in the same order the pseudocode will appear in the rendered games. The `tfsource` block is essentially the pseudocode of any single game, with variant content for other games interleaved via `\tfonly`.

**Use comments to label sections.** The source block is read by both you and TeXFrog. Comments like `%%% --- Oracle section ---` help orient readers and are harmless (comment lines are never wrapped).

**One game header per game.** If you use `\procedure` environments, put each game's procedure header as a `\tfonly*` call so only the right header appears in each game:

```latex
\procedure[linenumbering]{%
  \tfonly*{G0}{Starting game $= \indcca_\QSH^\adv.\REAL()$}%
  \tfonly*{G1}{Game~1}%
  \tfonly*{G2}{Game~2}%
  \tffigonly{Games $G_0$--$G_2$}%
}{...}
```

**Avoid blank lines in the source block.** Blank lines in output are stripped to prevent `varwidth` dimension errors in pseudocode environments like `pcvstack`. See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#dimension-too-large-from-pdflatex) for more on this error.

## Cropping Long Listings

For proofs with many hops, a diffed render of a later game can end up mostly repeating lines carried over unchanged from earlier games. Segment cropping lets you mark boundaries in the source so that a diffed `\tfrendergame` shows only the segments that actually changed, collapsing everything else into a single placeholder line.

> [!TIP]
> For a complete worked example, see [tutorial-crop/](../examples/tutorial-crop/): a five-step IND-CPA proof where each hop changes one line in one segment, so the cropped renders visibly collapse the rest.

### `\tfsegment{Caption}`

Marks a boundary between two segments inside a `tfsource` body. It never produces visible output itself in a full (uncropped) render — it is a pure boundary marker, invisible in every mode except a cropped render, where it decides where one segment ends and the next begins.

```latex
\begin{tfsource}{myproof}
\begin{algorithmic}
  \tfonly*{G0}{\Procedure{Game $\tfgamename{G0}$}{}}
  \tfsegment{Setup}
  \State b \gets \{0,1\}
  \tfsegment{Challenge}
  \tfonly{G1}{\State y \gets \{0,1\}^\lambda}
  \State \Return b
\end{algorithmic}
\end{tfsource}
```

Constraints:

- **Markers must sit at block depth 0** --- never inside a block body: `\If`/`\For`/`\While`, and equally `\Function`/`\Procedure`/`\Loop`/`\Repeat`. Each segment must be a balanced, self-contained block; a marker placed mid-block would let cropping drop the opener while keeping the closer (or vice versa), unbalancing the structure and producing invalid LaTeX (e.g. an `\EndFunction` with no `\Function`). This is a distinct failure from the brace-group one below: it applies to `algpseudocodex` functions/procedures too, not just cryptocode. `texfrog check` warns if a marker is found at nonzero depth for any of these constructs.
- Give every marker a non-empty caption --- `texfrog check` warns on an empty `\tfsegment{}`. The caption is what readers see in the collapsed stub.
- `\tfsegment` does not take a source-name argument; use it directly inside the `tfsource` body, the same way you use `\tfonly`.
- **A marker must be alone on its own line, and its caption must not contain braces.** `\tfsegment{Setup}` on its own line is correct; `\tfsegment{Setup \textbf{one}}` (braces in the caption) or `\State a \tfsegment{Mid}` (marker sharing a line with other content) are not — both are silently invisible to the split machinery that recognizes markers (a caption may not contain `{` or `}`), which desynchronizes segment/body alignment and produces a cryptic compile failure rather than a clear error. `texfrog check` warns whenever a line contains `\tfsegment` but doesn't match this plain form, including a marker accidentally nested inside a `\tfonly{...}` body.
- **Markers must sit at the top brace level of the `tfsource` body**, not nested inside a brace-group *argument* to another command (e.g. the second argument of `\procedure{Name}{...}`). The crop-render pass splits the *entire stored source* at marker positions; a marker inside such a group leaves each half of the split brace-unbalanced, which pdflatex reports as "Missing brace inserted" with no PDF produced. Line-based bodies (a bare `\begin{algorithmic}...\end{algorithmic}`, or a bare `\begin{nicodemus}...\end{nicodemus}` not wrapped in an extra box command) satisfy this naturally, since environments don't introduce a literal brace group around their content. See the cryptocode note below for the practical consequence.

The content before the first `\tfsegment` (segment 0, typically the environment opener, e.g. `\begin{algorithmic}`/procedure header) and the content after the last marker (the final segment, typically the environment closer, e.g. `\end{algorithmic}`) are **always kept** in a cropped render, whether or not they changed --- this guarantees the emitted output stays a balanced, compilable environment. Only segments strictly in between can ever be collapsed.

> [!WARNING]
> **Cropping is effectively unsupported for cryptocode.** cryptocode's pseudocode lines live inside the second (brace-delimited) argument of `\procedure{Name}{...}`, so a `\tfsegment` marker placed between lines is nested inside that brace group, not at the top brace level of the `tfsource` body — the constraint above. In practice this means a PDF crop render of a cryptocode proof fails to compile ("Missing brace inserted") unless every marker sits *between* complete `\procedure{...}{...}` blocks rather than between lines inside one. If you need cropping, use the `nicodemus` or `algpseudocodex` package profile, whose line-based bodies (`\begin{nicodemus}...\end{nicodemus}` / `\begin{algorithmic}...\end{algorithmic}`, not wrapped in an extra box command) don't have this restriction.

### `\tfcropdefault{on|off}`

Sets the document-wide default: when `on`, every diffed `\tfrendergame` call (i.e. one with `diff=`) crops to changed segments, unless overridden per call. This is a single global switch, not scoped per source name --- in a document with multiple proofs it applies to every `tfsource` block. `texfrog check` warns if `\tfcropdefault{on}` is set but the source has no `\tfsegment` markers, since cropping then has nothing to shrink.

```latex
\tfcropdefault{on}
```

### The `crop=on|off` key on `\tfrendergame`

Overrides `\tfcropdefault` for a single call:

```latex
\tfrendergame[diff=G3, crop=off]{myproof}{G4}   % force a full listing for this game
\tfrendergame[diff=G3, crop=on]{myproof}{G4}    % force cropping even if the default is off
```

Cropping only ever applies to a *diffed* render (`diff=` present) --- a clean, no-diff `\tfrendergame{myproof}{G4}` always renders the full game, regardless of `\tfcropdefault` or `crop=`.

> [!NOTE]
> **HTML vs PDF:** the `crop=` key is a **PDF-only** refinement. The HTML viewer compiles one SVG per game and has no per-call override --- HTML cropping is governed solely by `\tfcropdefault`. If you set `crop=off` (or `crop=on`) on a specific `\tfrendergame` call to differ from the document default, the PDF and the HTML viewer will show that game differently.

### What a cropped render looks like

A cropped render keeps segment 0, the final segment, and every segment that differs from the diff target (an add, change, or removal anywhere in that segment). Each unchanged interior segment collapses into its own `\tfsegmentstub{caption}` line — one stub per collapsed segment, each on its own line, so a run of several unchanged segments produces several stub lines.

**Line numbers stay absolute** (`algpseudocodex` only). When the pseudocode is numbered (`\begin{algorithmic}[1]`), the kept lines keep the numbers they hold in the *full* listing, so a given line has the same number in every game's render. Because the collapsed lines keep their numbers too, the visible numbering **jumps** across each stub (e.g. `15` then `47`) — the gap signals how much was elided, alongside the `(unchanged)` caption. This works in both the PDF and the HTML viewer. Packages that don't number lines (`cryptocode`, `nicodemus`) are unaffected.

### Redefining the stub: `\tfsegmentstub{captions}`

The elision line is produced by the user-redefinable macro `\tfsegmentstub{captions}`, which receives the joined caption text as its single argument. The base default renders a dimmed, unnumbered line, e.g.:

```
⋯ Setup, Challenge (unchanged) ⋯
```

Its exact form already varies by package profile --- `cryptocode` stays in math mode and adds a trailing `\\`; `nicodemus` prefixes `\item`; `algpseudocodex` uses `\Statex` --- but you can redefine it further if you want different wording or styling:

```latex
\renewcommand{\tfsegmentstub}[1]{\Statex \textcolor{gray}{[#1 unchanged]}}
```

## Package-Specific Notes

### cryptocode (default)

- Lines end with `\\` as a separator (except the last line of each procedure body)
- Content is in math mode (inside `\procedure` environments)
- `\tfchanged` wraps content in `$...$` for text-mode containers
- Consolidated figures insert `\\` between adjacent game-specific lines
- `\tfgamelabel` uses `\pccomment` for inline game labels

### nicodemus

- Lines start with `\item` (enumerate-based pseudocode)
- Content is in text mode (inside `\begin{nicodemus}` environments)
- `\tfchanged` wraps content directly (no math-mode wrapping)
- `\item` prefix is kept outside `\tfchanged{}` to preserve list structure
- Consolidated figures do NOT insert `\\` between lines
- `\tfgamelabel` outputs the content without a comment macro

### algpseudocodex

- Lines start with `\State` (or `\Statex`), the algorithmicx-based syntax (inside `algorithmic` environments)
- Content is in text mode, like nicodemus (no math-mode wrapping)
- `\State` prefix is kept outside `\tfchanged{}`: algorithmicx's `\State` does real vertical-mode box/`\prevdepth` bookkeeping that breaks if nested inside the highlight box
- `\Procedure` lines are treated as structural headers and never wrapped with `\tfchanged`
- Consolidated figures do NOT insert `\\` between lines
- `\tfgamelabel` uses `\Comment` for inline game labels
