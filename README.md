TeXFrog helps cryptographers manage game-hopping proofs in LaTeX. If you have ever maintained a dozen nearly-identical game files by hand, copying lines between them and trying to keep highlights consistent, TeXFrog is meant to solve that problem.

**Key idea:** Write your pseudocode once in a single `.tex` file. Tag content with the games it belongs to using `\tfonly{games}{content}` commands. TeXFrog produces:

- Individual per-game renderings with changed lines automatically highlighted (via `pdflatex` — no extra tools needed)
- Consolidated comparison figures showing multiple games side by side (via `pdflatex`)
- An interactive HTML viewer for navigating the proof in a browser (via the optional Python CLI)

All from that one source file.

TeXFrog currently supports the [`cryptocode`](https://ctan.org/pkg/cryptocode), [`nicodemus`](https://github.com/TeXFrog/TeXFrog/blob/main/resources/nicodemus.sty) (by Bertram Poettering; not on CTAN, bundled with TeXFrog), and [`algpseudocodex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/algpseudocodex) pseudocode packages, and we are open to supporting others.

## What The Source Code Looks Like

A snippet of the source file:

```latex
\tfonly{G0-G2}{k \getsr \{0,1\}^\lambda \\}
...
\tfonly{G0}{y \gets \mathrm{PRF}(k, r) \\}
\tfonly{G1}{y \getsr \{0,1\}^\lambda \\}
\tfonly{Red1}{y \gets \OPRF(r) \\}
...
\tfonly{G0,G1,Red1}{c \gets y \oplus m_b \\}
\tfonly{G2}{c \getsr \{0,1\}^\lambda \\}
```

Content outside `\tfonly` appears in every game. Content inside `\tfonly{tags}{...}` appears only in the listed games. Ranges like `G0-G2` are resolved by position in the game list, so reductions interleaved between games work naturally.

When you want to include game figures in a certain spot in your paper:

```latex
\tfrendergame{myproof}{G1}
\tfrendergame[diff=G1]{myproof}{G2}
```

## Cropping Long Listings

For proofs with many hops, a diffed render can end up mostly showing lines carried over unchanged from earlier games. Mark segment boundaries in the source with `\tfsegment{Caption}`, then opt in to cropping:

```latex
\tfcropdefault{on}                              % crop every diffed render by default
\tfrendergame[diff=G3, crop=off]{myproof}{G4}   % force a full listing for this one call
```

A cropped render keeps only the segments that changed relative to the diff target (plus the always-kept opening and closing segments), collapsing runs of unchanged segments into a single elision line produced by the redefinable `\tfsegmentstub{captions}` macro. `\tfsegment` markers must sit at block depth 0 (never inside an `\If`/`\For`/`\While`), and the `crop=` key is PDF-only --- the HTML viewer follows only `\tfcropdefault`. See [Writing a proof](https://github.com/TeXFrog/TeXFrog/blob/main/docs/writing-proofs.md#cropping-long-listings) for the full reference.

## Installation

TeXFrog has two components. Most users only need the LaTeX package.

### Option 1: LaTeX package only (no Python required)

If you just want to write game-hopping proofs in LaTeX with automatic diff highlighting and consolidated figures, all you need is the `texfrog.sty` file. No Python, no command line tools, no virtual environments.

**Local installation:**

1. Download [`texfrog.sty`](https://github.com/TeXFrog/TeXFrog/blob/main/latex/texfrog.sty) from the repository.
2. Place it in the same directory as your `.tex` file (or anywhere TeX can find it).
3. Add `\usepackage[package=cryptocode]{texfrog}` to your preamble.
4. Compile with `pdflatex` as usual.

**On Overleaf:** Upload `texfrog.sty` to your project and use it like any other local package.

This gives you everything needed to render individual games (`\tfrendergame`), consolidated comparison figures (`\tfrenderfigure`), and automatic change highlighting — all at compile time. See the [tutorial-cryptocode-quickstart](https://github.com/TeXFrog/TeXFrog/tree/main/examples/tutorial-cryptocode-quickstart) example for a complete working document.

### Option 2: Full installation (Python CLI + LaTeX package)

The Python CLI adds an interactive HTML proof viewer, validation, scaffolding, and live-reload. Install it if you want the `texfrog` command-line tool.

**Requirements:**

- **Python** >= 3.10
- **LaTeX** — [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) or [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) (for `pdflatex` and `pdfcrop`)
- **Poppler** or **pdf2svg** — for `pdftocairo` (`brew install poppler` on macOS), or `pdf2svg` as an alternative

LaTeX and Poppler are needed for the HTML viewer (`texfrog html`).

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install texfrog
```

Many Python installations don't let you install global packages, so you'll need to create a virtual environment:

```bash
cd my_working_directory      # wherever you want to install the venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # on macOS/Linux; use .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install texfrog
```

When you open a new terminal session and want to run TeXFrog, you will need to reactivate the Python virtual environment:

```bash
cd my_working_directory      # wherever you installed the venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # on macOS/Linux; use .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

After activating the virtual environment, you can `cd` to any directory on your computer and run the `texfrog` command.

## Quick Start

### Starting from the LaTeX package only

The fastest way to get started without Python is to copy the [tutorial-cryptocode-quickstart](https://github.com/TeXFrog/TeXFrog/tree/main/examples/tutorial-cryptocode-quickstart) example and modify it. Download `texfrog.sty`, `main.tex`, and `macros.tex`, then compile with `pdflatex`. On Overleaf, upload all three files to a new project.

### Starting with the Python CLI

The fastest way to start a new proof is with `texfrog init`. This creates a minimal, runnable proof (`proof.tex`, `macros.tex`, `commentary/*.tex`, and a `.gitignore`) with comments explaining each field.

```bash
# Scaffold a new proof in the current directory using cryptocode for pseudocode
texfrog init

# ... or in a new directory
texfrog init mydirectory

# ... or using the nicodemus package for pseudocode
texfrog init myproof --package nicodemus

# ... or using the algpseudocodex package for pseudocode
texfrog init myproof --package algpseudocodex
```

The [TeXFrog repository contains tutorials](https://github.com/TeXFrog/TeXFrog/tree/main/examples) you can study:

```bash
# Download them from https://github.com/TeXFrog/TeXFrog/tree/main/examples
# or clone the repository using the following two lines:
git clone https://github.com/TeXFrog/TeXFrog
cd TeXFrog/examples

# Interactive HTML viewer with live reload
texfrog html serve tutorial-cryptocode/main.tex
```

## Usage

### Scaffold a new proof

```bash
texfrog init [DIRECTORY] [--package cryptocode|nicodemus|algpseudocodex]
```

Creates starter files in `DIRECTORY` (default: current directory). The `--package` option selects the pseudocode package (default: `cryptocode`). Existing files are never overwritten.

### Validate a proof

```bash
texfrog check proof.tex [--strict]
```

Parses the proof and runs validation checks (file existence, tag consistency, empty games, commentary references) without generating any output. Prints a summary and exits with code 0 if valid. With `--strict`, exits with code 1 if there are any warnings.

### Generate HTML output

```bash
texfrog html build proof.tex [-o OUTPUT_DIR]
```

Compiles each game to SVG via `pdflatex` and produces a self-contained HTML site. Open `index.html` in any browser. Games are shown side by side with changed lines highlighted, and you can navigate with arrow keys.

### Open in a local web server

```bash
texfrog html serve proof.tex [--port 8080] [--no-live-reload]
```

Builds the HTML site, starts a local server, and opens your browser. By default, TeXFrog watches your source files and automatically rebuilds and refreshes the web browser when you save changes. Use `--no-live-reload` to disable this.

## Writing a Proof

You need a single `.tex` file that serves as both the LaTeX document and the TeXFrog source:

- **`proof.tex`** — declares the list of games and reductions, contains the pseudocode source with `\tfonly` tags, and optionally specifies commentary, figures, and which pseudocode package to use

See [Writing a proof](https://github.com/TeXFrog/TeXFrog/blob/main/docs/writing-proofs.md) for a full guide, and the [tutorials](#included-examples) for worked examples.

## Available Examples

All examples compile directly with `pdflatex` — no Python needed. Just place `texfrog.sty` in the same directory.

| Directory | Description | Package | Live Demo |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| [`examples/tutorial-cryptocode-quickstart/`](https://github.com/TeXFrog/TeXFrog/tree/main/examples/tutorial-cryptocode-quickstart) | Minimal IND-CPA proof (recommended starting point) | `cryptocode` | |
| [`examples/tutorial-cryptocode/`](https://github.com/TeXFrog/TeXFrog/tree/main/examples/tutorial-cryptocode) | Same proof with detailed walkthrough and commentary | `cryptocode` | [View demo](https://texfrog.github.io/demos/tutorial-cryptocode/) |
| [`examples/tutorial-nicodemus/`](https://github.com/TeXFrog/TeXFrog/tree/main/examples/tutorial-nicodemus) | Same proof using `nicodemus` syntax | `nicodemus` | [View demo](https://texfrog.github.io/demos/tutorial-nicodemus/) |
| [`examples/tutorial-algpseudocodex/`](https://github.com/TeXFrog/TeXFrog/tree/main/examples/tutorial-algpseudocodex) | Same proof using `algpseudocodex` syntax | `algpseudocodex` | |
| [`examples/example-multiproof/`](https://github.com/TeXFrog/TeXFrog/tree/main/examples/example-multiproof) | Multiple proofs in one document | `cryptocode` | |

Comparing the cryptocode, nicodemus, and algpseudocodex tutorials shows the syntax differences between pseudocode packages.
