    r"""Wrap a changed pseudocode line with a highlighting macro.

    Several kinds of lines are returned **verbatim** (never wrapped):

    * Pure comment lines (starting with ``%``)
    * Lines ending with ``{`` (or ``{%``) — structural brace openers
      (procedure headers, ``\nicodemusbox{...}{%``)
    * ``\markersetlen`` lines — layout-only dimension commands
    * ``\begin{...}`` / ``\end{...}`` lines — environment boundaries

    For lines ending with ``\\`` (cryptocode-style line separator), the
    ``\\`` is placed *outside* the macro call so the macro only wraps the
    visual content:

        \tfchanged{\key_1 \gets ...} \\

    For lines starting with ``\item`` (nicodemus-style), the ``\item``
    prefix is placed *outside* the macro call:

        \item \tfchanged{$content$}

    For lines ending with ``%`` (LaTeX newline suppressor), the ``%`` is
    placed *outside* the macro call so it does not comment out the closing
    brace:

        \tfchanged{content}%

    For lines starting with ``\State`` (algorithmicx-style packages, e.g.
    algpseudocodex), the ``\State`` prefix is placed *outside* the macro
    call, exactly like ``\item``:

        \State \tfchanged{$\key_1 \gets ...$}

    (``\State``'s internals do real vertical-mode box/prevdepth bookkeeping
    that breaks if nested inside the highlight box, so it cannot be wrapped
    along with its content the way plain math/text can.)

    Args:
        line: A single content line (no tag comment).
        macro: The LaTeX macro name to use for wrapping (default ``\tfchanged``).

    Returns:
        The wrapped line string.
